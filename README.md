> **CAPTCHA** stands for *Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.* It is a security measure used on websites to determine if a user is a human or a bot. CAPTCHAs typically involve presenting users with a challenge that is easy for humans to solve but difficult for automated programs to complete. The purpose of CAPTCHA is to prevent bots from performing actions that could be harmful or disruptive, such as creating multiple accounts, submitting spam, or conducting brute-force attacks on login pages.

CAPTCHA is a **RESTful API** for the Amharic language. Amharic is the official language of Ethiopia and is spoken by millions of people. Amharic CAPTCHA is designed to verify that the user attempting to access a website or perform an action is a human and not a bot. Amharic CAPTCHA works by presenting users with a challenge in the Amharic language that requires human understanding and interpretation to solve. This challenge may involve tasks such as selecting the correct Amharic word or phrase, transcribing Amharic characters, or answering questions related to Amharic culture or language. The purpose of Amharic CAPTCHA, like any other CAPTCHA, is to prevent automated bots from accessing or interacting with a website. By using the Amharic language, it adds an additional layer of difficulty for bots to overcome, as they would need to have language processing capabilities to accurately interpret and respond to the Amharic challenge.
